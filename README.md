  Here are a few projects I worked on in my last workplace:  
  **Liability and Large Loss Prediction**
  The company needed to know what would be the ultimate cost of those accidents that the customers had purchased insurance for. My responsibility was to understand the problem, talk with the stakeholders, prepare the data, suggest and build a solution, test it, present it and put it into production.
  The job was to read the incident description written by people on the field and come up with an estimate of the total cost. I built a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow with transfer learning.  
  Another part of this project was to understand the existence of liability in these same accidents. Liability is defined as the involvement of a third party. Again, I built a deep learning model to classify the accidents. I was able to achieve more than 90% accuracy with my model.
  Some of the tools I used are: TensorFlow, NLP, Transformers, BERT, CNN, Databricks, Scala, SQL, Matplotlib, Emacs  

  **Customer Segmentation Model for the Marketing Department**
  The company needed to know which customers to target with its marketing endeavors. I built a set of models to predict customer churn, expected revenue from each customer, and expected number of rentals from each customer. Again, I worked with stakeholders to understand the problem and came up with the models that would get the job done.
  I used the past data on customers, excluding PII, to build classification and regression models.  
  These models helped the marketing department to tailor its marketing efforts to a selected audience, increasing the return rate on marketing budget and customer engagement.  
  Here are some the tools that I used: Python, XGBoost, seaborn, Grid search, Azure Environments, Azure Pipelines, SQL

  **Machine Learning on Azure**
  This is a project that I worked on my own. I wanted to prepare a set of files to help people automate their machine learning work on Azure. Azure Machine Learning Studio provides a good number of services to help data scientist do their work, but it can be overwhelming to use all these features. In these Notebook files, I provided sample code to register data assets, prepare custom environments, automate machine learning with trying different models with very little code, track -metrics -parameters -artifacts (files) during training, hyperparameter tuning and batch inferencing. I provided more information in the readme file of the repository. Here is the link: https://github.com/california-19/Azure_ML_Engineering
